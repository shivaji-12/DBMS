Consider the schema for Company Database:
EMPLOYEE(SSN, Name, Address, Sex, Salary, SuperSSN, DNo)
DEPARTMENT(DNo, DName, MgrSSN, MgrStartDate)
 DLOCATION(DNo,DLoc)
 PROJECT(PNo, PName, PLocation, DNo)
 WORKS_ON(SSN, PNo, Hours)
1.For each department that has more than five employees, retrieve the department number and the number of its employees who are making more than Rs. 6,00,000.
2. Show the resulting salaries if every employee working on the ‘IoT’ project is given a 10 percent raise.

_____________________________________________________
SELECT DNo, COUNT(*) AS Num_Employees
FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE Salary > 600000
GROUP BY DNo
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;


UPDATE EMPLOYEE
SET Salary = Salary * 1.1
WHERE SSN IN (
  SELECT SSN
  FROM WORKS_ON
  WHERE PNo = (SELECT PNo FROM PROJECT WHERE PName = 'IoT')
);
